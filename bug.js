This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.manifest` object to access app information.  Specifically, when the app is built for Android, the `Constants.manifest.version` returns `undefined` instead of the expected version number. This can cause issues with feature flags and version-dependent logic within the application.  The issue is intermittent; sometimes the value is returned correctly and sometimes not. The problem seems related to the asynchronous nature of retrieving the manifest information and might be exacerbated by fast app startups or background processes.
